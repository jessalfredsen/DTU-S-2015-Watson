Working with the Personality Insights API from Watson

# Social media personalities and IBM Watson Personality Insights

## Abstract

Through various existing work, it is established that targeted or even personalized advertisement works a lot better than non targeted advertisement. Hence, there is a strong desire to utilize data from twitter and other social media to gain insights into how customers should be approached. The social platforms are places where users express emotions, experiences and interests. This data can be used to characterize a user and predict wants and needs, and even personality details and emotions, which can be used to select the best way to approach a given user. In the following paper we analyze the Personality Insights API from the IBM Watson platform. We look at how this analysis can be utilized to select the best strategy to approach a user, from a business perspective. 

## Learning objectives
